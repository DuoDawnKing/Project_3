# Project_3
In this Project, we will be developing various portfolios and trading algorithms for those portfolios and then set it as an option for the user to pick and chose using django.


The project will be use a few new things such as monti carlo and more to determine returns and try to establish a perfect volatility/return aspect. In terms of Efficent Market Hypothesis and Random Walk Hypothesis thye suggest that we wouldnt be able to calculate future growth or potential earning but we can use scipy and monti to determine possible ways to invest in portfolios to get maximum growth and set up trade alogrithms buy sell or hold various portfolios that were developed. 


For the django, we would set it up to where the person can do research info to pull and show various stocks and assets so they would determine if they were interested in a stock they could go to customize_portfolio and add the stock.

In the recommended stock, it ask the user if they wanted long term, short term or retirement stock, which would be used to then give a portfolio that was already generated and then give results of PSR potential earning growth and more.

Retirement 1 stock had MCD,PG,PEP,MET,CVX as stocks, 4 of which were beta meaning they had a huge impact in the market. 1 was an alpha meaning that regardless of the outcome it wont have an affect on the market.

The algoirthms would have stayed in the the user folder in django, so that they could live watch the changes in the project and more.

Part of the project was to get a robo advisor to function properly, which would of been used as the one to do QA for the recommended portfolio
